# E-Farm-Automated-irrigation-

 Due to the population explosion occuring in our country, the pressure to produce more food per unit area of land is increasing. In such a situation it would be quite useful to a farmer if the amount of resources used, such as water, use is optimised. ‚óè Our project intends to use sensor data to automate the irrigation process as well as provide this information to the farmer to help him make more informed decisions.
